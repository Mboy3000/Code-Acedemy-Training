## Linking the CSS file 
Perfect! We successfully separated structure (HTML) from styling (CSS), but the web page still looks bland why?

When HTML and CSS codes are in separate files, the files must be linked. Otherwise, the HTML file won't be able to locate the CSS code, and the styling will not be applied. 

You can use the link element to link HTML and CSS files together. The link element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self closing tag and requires the following attributes"

### href

Like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file. 

### rel
This attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
