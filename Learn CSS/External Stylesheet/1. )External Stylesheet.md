## External Style sheet
Developers avoid mixing code by storing HTML and CSS code in separate files (HTML) files contain only HTML code, and CSS files contains only CSS code
You can create an external stylesheet by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css
With an external stylesheet, you can write all the CSS code you needed to style a page without sacrificing the readability and maintainability of your HTML file. 

### Instructions
Take a look at index.html. Cut the CSS code ruleset in between in between the opening and closing style tags and paste it directly into the file called style.css. 

Delete the remaining style element (Now empty from index.html and press the run button)
