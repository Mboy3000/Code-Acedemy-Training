## Video and embed
Media content can be a useful addition to a website. By using a video element, we can add videos to our website. The video element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user. 

    Some attributes that can alter video playback include:

### controls: 
    When added in, a play pause button will be added onto the video along with volume control and a full screen option.

### autoplay: 
The attribute which results in a video automatically playing as soon as the page is loaded. 

### loop
This attribute results in the video continuously playing on repeat.
